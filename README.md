# Foodster
As smartphones have progressed exponentially in the recent decade, the need for innovative mobile applications is essential now more than ever. Computer Scientists have developed a wide range of platforms and system architectures to simplify the development of mobile applications while making them more robust. These developments create a need for a new depth of knowledge that developers must understand and learn. There are numerous programming languages, various modules and libraries, and plenty of platforms to develop a mobile web application. I wanted to learn those libraries, modules, and frameworks that would help me develop a cross-platform mobile application that can run on any device. 
I came up with the idea of Foodster because it encompassed all my areas of interest and all the skills I wanted to learn while working on this project. I wanted to learn to use geo-location to target nearby users for restaurants to advertise themselves. It was in my interest to implement the feature of users following restaurants and receiving their updates on deals and coupons via posts on their home page. I desired to develop a prototype of a large-scale application to learn the perks of systems architecture and design.
